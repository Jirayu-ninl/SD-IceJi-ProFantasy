# ProFantasy

## " ProFantasy was tested with a huge of scenarios, and fine-tuning several times to ensure that you will be able to create a FANTASY image in your own way "
This model merges with my own 3 models called R-base (realistic), F-base (Fantasy), and V-base (Vibrant) mixed together with 3 formulas Real, Mix, and Max (but in v2, these will combine into one)

#### *** This Model needs VAE !!! ***

## Overview:

* The purpose of this model is to generate epic fantasy images not only Realistic but Animation also.
* These models require a VAE. You can try mse-840000-ema or anything. I have a photo of the comparison in the Comparision section (below)
* If you got bugs, adding '--no-half-vae' to the argument will solve it.

## Recommends:

* You use it with any steps, prompt, sampler, ... (anything you want)
* Prompt: If you don't know what to prompt, Fantasy Prompts by TxcTrtl is a great choice.
* * Steps: I recommend 30-45 (You can use higher, but many times do not have a big difference)
* Sampler: I developed it with DPM++ 2S a Karras, so I recommend this sampler (but others also work fine)
* Sizes: 512x512, 512x768, 512x904 (Can be used both vertically and horizontally). Not recommended sizes more than 768x768
* Hires. fix: Use Denoising strength less than 0.6 (but you can try >= 0.7, sometimes you will get problems with the hands)

## Versioning:

* v1: Pilot version. Aim to be realistic (Cinematic style, Realistic photo, less fantasy)
* v2: All tunned. It's stable since version 2.1
